## Shine On You Crazy Fractal

This app was developed at first just to paint the [**Julia Set**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) *(a subset of the Mandelbrot Set)* of Fractals. A Julia Set is generated using a fixed point in the **Complex Plane** as a seed when evaluating all the points of the plane in a quadratic polynomial.

The **[Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)** uses each point where its evaluating the polynomial as the seed.

What I thought then was, what if I draw one **Julia Set** per frame, varying slightly the *'fixed seed'* parameter? This results in an animation of an *'evolving'* fractal since the proximity of the seed values yields similar fractals.

When people think of fractals, they first think of zooming them up infinitely which has nice psychedelic patterns showing up. But what about fractals that don't zoom, but mutate? That leads to nice psychedelic patterns forming too!

### Showcasing Video

*'Now there's a look in your eyes, like Black Holes in the sky'*  
-Pink Floyd, Shine On You Crazy Diamond

### Some Poetry
*For all those fractal hearts  
Convoluted, and complex  
No matter how deep, full of detail  
The intrinsic shape of the universe*  

When I watch this video, I can't help but notice how it continously cycles from two separate main bodies into a single one and viceversa. It looks as if two galaxies were dancing around each other, merging, and separating, and merging, and separating. The dynamics of galaxy collissions shows that when they are on a collision course, they sort of dance around each other, then go through each other, then separate, then go across each other again, until their cores merge and stabilize. **Luckily for fractals, their dance can go on forever.**
